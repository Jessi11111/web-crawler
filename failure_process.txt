1. frist, tried throw plp links to LLM by setting up the prompt to get the pdp links output in json file. I modified lots of prompt version. no one worked.
PLP_PROMPT = """Analyze the plp_content(html) above and extract **ALL** valid Product Detail Page (PDP) URLs.  

        ### Definitions:
        - **PDP (Product Detail Page)**: 
        A URL linking to a *specific product* with:
        1. Base path: `/brand/wedding-dresses/`
        2. Contains either:
            - A product ID (e.g., `/88415/`)
            - A product name slug (e.g., `/ballgown-dress/`)
        3. *May include* `?plp_url=...` or other query parameters.

        ### Rules:
        1. **Include ONLY URLs** matching ALL these criteria:
        - Domain: 'https://www.allurebridals.com', 'https://www.essensedesigns.com', 'https://www.maggiesottero.com','https://justinalexander.com'
        - Structure: Has a product ID or name (e.g., `/88415/` or `/ballgown-dress/`)
        - Examples:
            ✅ `https://justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/88415/?plp_url=...`
            ✅ `https://justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/ballgown-dress/`
            ❌ `https://justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/` (PLP, not PDP)
            ❌ `https://justinalexander.com/cart/` (non-product page)

        2. **Exclude**:
        - Duplicates, filters, or non-product links.
        - URLs without a product ID/name in the path.

        3. **Return JSON** (no other text):
        ```json
        {{"pdp_links": ["url1", "url2"]}} 
        Content: {plp_content}"""


failed because LLM can process links like a browser. we need to feed LLM at least some data in order to extract data.

2. use crawl4ai to process plp links to get pdp links ( use reasult.link() ). Important: those result.link needed clean and pattern match. I did it!!! At least for the lazy load plp page. I got 150 pdp links from Justin.
And then use crawl4ai to process each pdp link to get some result( either result.markdown, result.cleaned_html, result_extracted_content )
And then throw those results to LLM to extract info that we need. For example:
    "id": "product_id",
    "Name": "product_name",
    "Description": "product_description",
    "crawl_date": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"


failed (reason unknown)
2025-04-04 15:29:40,601 - ERROR - Error processing PDP https://www.justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/88334/?plp_url=/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/: BrowserType.launch: Target page, context or browser has been closed

potential cause:
          Resource Management Issues   -->???
          Timeout Issues               --> fix some config
          Memory/Resource Exhaustion   --> divide the pdp links into smaller batch, batch_size = 5


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> OKAYYYY!!!  LOL 
this error is caused by Crawl4ai!!!

@LLazzar @JohayerChowdury Yes. This issue was already reported in #842 . It's already root caused and patched. Will be released shortly. Closing this issue as duplicate, so that progress can be tracked in a single issue on #842.

3. I tried put all pdp links to mongo collection that i new started under the database competitors
 pdp links in mongodb:
        _id:67f034621a4a39537c8097b9
        url:"https://www.justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/88365…"
        found_date:"2025-04-04 14:34:58"
        status:"pending"
        first_found:"2025-04-04 14:34:58"
and retrieve pdp links collections from mongo, then throw those into crawl4ai???
