2025-04-04 11:41:29,312 - ERROR - Error processing PDP https://www.justinalexander.com/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/88203/?plp_url=/justin-alexander/wedding-dresses/: BrowserType.launch: Target page, context or browser has been closed


1.Error Type: BrowserType.launch: Target page, context or browser has been closed
This indicates the browser instance was closed before the operation completed
2.Root Causes:   async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as crawler:
       pdp_result = await crawler.arun(url=pdp_url, config=crawler_config)
The browser is being closed too early because:
The context manager (async with) is closing the browser
Multiple URLs are being processed with the same browser instance
3.Solution:
  a.Separate Browser Instances:
  Main crawler for PLP pages
  Individual crawler for each PDP page
  b.Improved Resource Management:   # Main crawler for PLP pages
   async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as main_crawler:
       # New crawler for each PDP
       async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config) as pdp_crawler:
  c.Consistent Configuration:
  Moved configurations outside the loops
  Same settings for all crawlers
  d.Better Error Isolation:
  Each PDP has its own browser instance
  Failures don't affect other pages
