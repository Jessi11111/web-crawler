How MongoDB Cursor Timeout Affects Classification?
What Happens?

When you query MongoDB (e.g., db.collection.find()), it returns a cursor (a pointer to the query results).

By default, cursors auto-close after 10 minutes of inactivity (server-side).

If your classification takes too long (e.g., processing large files with Llama3-70B), the cursor expires, and you get:

python
CursorNotFound: cursor id X not found
Why After 27 Files?

Likely, processing those files took >10 minutes, triggering the timeout.

The longer each file takes (e.g., due to slow GPU inference), the sooner the cursor dies.
